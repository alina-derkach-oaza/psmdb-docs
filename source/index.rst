Percona Server for MongoDB |version| Documentation
==================================================

|Percona Server for MongoDB| is a free, enhanced, fully compatible, open source, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 3.0 Community Edition with enterprise-grade features. It requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

Percona Server for MongoDB provides:

* MongoDB's original `MMAPv1 <https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/mmapv1/>`_ storage engine as the default, and `WiredTiger <https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/wiredtiger/>`_ as an alternative
* Optional :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` and `MongoRocks <http://rocksdb.org>`_ storage engines
* :ref:`Percona TokuBackup <toku-backup>` for creating dynamic backups while data remains fully accessible and writable (*hot backup*)
* :ref:`External SASL authentication <ext-auth>` using OpenLDAP or Active Directory
* :ref:`Audit logging <audit-log>` to track and query database interactions of users or applications

.. note:: MongoRocks is currently considered experimental.
