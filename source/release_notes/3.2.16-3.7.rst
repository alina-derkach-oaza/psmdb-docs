=====================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of
|PSMDB| 3.2.16-3.7 on September 27, 2017.
Downloads are available

and from the :ref:`Percona Software Repositories <install>`.

|PSMDB| is a highly scalable,
zero-maintenance downtime database
supporting the MongoDB v3.2 protocol and drivers.
It extends MongoDB with :ref:`mongorocks`,
:ref:`inmemory`, and :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` storage engines,
as well as several enterprise features.
Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

.. note:: The PerconaFT storage engine has been deprecated
   and will not be available in future releases.

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.2.16
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.2/#jul-27-2017>`_
and includes the following additional changes:

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-164`: Fixed :ref:`mongorocks` failure to repair
  if database metadata is inconsistent with dropped collections and indexes.

* Added packages for Debian 9 ("stretch").
