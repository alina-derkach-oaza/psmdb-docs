Percona announces the release of Percona Server for MongoDB |release|
on November 23, 2018. Download the latest version from the Percona web
site or the Percona Software Repositories.

Percona Server for MongoDB 3.4 is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable
database that is a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 3.4
Community Edition. It supports MongoDB 3.4 protocols and drivers.

Percona Server for MongoDB extends MongoDB Community Edition functionality by
including the Percona Memory Engine and MongoRocks storage engines, as well as
several enterprise-grade features:

- `External Authentication <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/authentication.html>`_
- `Audit Logging <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/audit-logging.html>`_
- `Profiling Rate Limiting <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/rate-limit.html>`_
- `Hot Backup <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/hot-backup.html>`_
- `Log Redaction <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/log-redaction.html>`_

Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code. 

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.4.18
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4/#nov-7-2018>`_. There
are the following improvements on top of those upstream fixes.


Improvements
================================================================================

- :jirabug:`PSMDB-247`: Now, ``AuditLog`` formats are listed in the output of
  ``mongod --help`` and ``mongos --help`` commands
- :jirabug:`BLD-1152`: The installation of new versions of PSMDB could fail on
  Debian based systems, as the apt package manager did not correctly check for
  already installed MongoDB clients.

.. rubric:: Other improvements

- :jirabug:`238`: ``audit_drop_database.js`` test occasionally fails with ``MMAPv1``

.. |release| replace:: 3.4.18-2.16
