Percona Server for MongoDB 3.2.13-3.3
=====================================

Percona is glad to announce the release of
Percona Server for MongoDB 3.2.13-3.3 on May 15, 2017.
Downloads are available
`here <https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-3.2>`_
and from the :ref:`Percona Software Repositories <install>`.

Percona Server for MongoDB is a highly scalable,
zero-maintenance downtime database
supporting the MongoDB v3.2 protocol and drivers.
It extends MongoDB with :ref:`mongorocks`,
:ref:`inmemory`, and :ref:`PerconaFT <perconaft>` storage engines,
as well as several enterprise features.
Percona Server for MongoDB requires no changes to MongoDB applications or code.

.. note:: The PerconaFT storage engine has been deprecated
   and will not be available in future releases.

This release is based on `MongoDB 3.2.13
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.2/#may-1-2017>`_
and includes the following additional fixes:

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-127`: Fixed cleanup of deleted documents and indexes
  for *MongoRocks*.
  When you upgrade to this release,
  deferred compaction may occur and cause database size
  to decrease significantly.

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-133`: Added the ``wiredTigerCheckpointSizeMB`` variable,
  set to ``1000`` in the configration template for *WiredTiger*.
  Valid values are 32 to 2048 (2GB), with the latter being default.

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-138`: Implemented `SERVER-23418
  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-23418>`_ for *MongoRocks*.
