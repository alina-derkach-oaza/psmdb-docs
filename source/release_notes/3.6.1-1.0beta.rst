Known Issues
------------

* :jirabug:`PSMDB-184` - MongoRocks reindexing collection or repairing database
  causes query to return ``0`` or null in read concern majority.

* MongoDB has its own notion of time, including an expected commit order for
  transactions that may be inconsistent with the order assigned by MongoRocks,
  this can cause server to crash in replica sets, and majority reads in highly
  concurrent environments.
