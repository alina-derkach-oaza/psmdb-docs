Percona announces the GA release of |PSMDB| |release| on |date|. Download the
latest version from the `Percona website`_ or the `Percona software repositories`_.

|PSMDB| is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable database that is a
fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for |mongodb-ce|.  It supports |mongodb|
4.0 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends the functionality of the |mongodb-ce| by including the
:ref:`inmemory` storage engine, as well as several enterprise-grade
features. |PSMDB| requires no changes to |mongodb| applications or code.

This release `includes all features

4.0. Most notable among these are:

- `Multi-Document ACID transactions
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#multi-document-transactions>`_
- `Type conversion through the new aggregation operators
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#new-type-conversion-operators>`_
- `Enhancements to the Change Streams support
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#database-and-deployment-change-streams>`_

Note that the `MMAPv1 storage engine is deprecated
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/#deprecate-mmapv1>`_
in |mongodb-ce| 4.0.

In |PSMDB| |release|, *data at rest encryption* is General Availability
feature. It is ready for use in a production environment.

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

- :psmdb-bug:`235`: In some cases, hot backup did not back up the
  :dir:`keydb` directory; |mongod| could crash after restore.
- :psmdb-bug:`233`: When starting |PSMDB| with WiredTiger
  encryption options but using a different storage engine, the server started
  normally and produced no warnings that these options had been ignored
- :psmdb-bug:`239`: The WiredTiger encryption was not disabled when using the
  `Percona Memory Engine
  <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.6/inmemory.html#inmemory>`_
  storage engine.
- :psmdb-bug:`241`: WiredTiger per database encryption keys were not
  purged when the database was deleted
- :psmdb-bug:`243`: A log message was added to indicate that the
  server is running with encryption
- :psmdb-bug:`245`: KeyDBâ€™s WiredTiger logs were not properly rotated
  without restarting the server.
- :psmdb-bug:`246`: The server would not start after restoring an
  encrypted database from hotbackup where a wrong master key was
  specified
