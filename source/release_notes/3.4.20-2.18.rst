|Percona| announces the release of |PSMDB| |release| on
|date|. Download the latest version from the |Percona| web site or the
Percona Software Repositories.

|PSMDB| 3.4 is an enhanced, open source, and highly-scalable
database that is a fully-compatible, drop-in replacement for MongoDB 3.4
Community Edition. It supports |MongoDB| 3.4 protocols and drivers.

|PSMDB| extends MongoDB Community Edition functionality by including
the Percona Memory Engine and MongoRocks storage engines, as well as
several enterprise-grade features:

- `External Authentication <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/authentication.html>`_
- `Audit Logging <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/audit-logging.html>`_
- `Profiling Rate Limiting <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/rate-limit.html>`_
- `Hot Backup <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/hot-backup.html>`_
- `Log Redaction <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/3.4/log-redaction.html>`_

|PSMDB| requires no changes to MongoDB applications or
code. This release is based on `MongoDB 3.4.20
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4/#mar-13-2019>`_.

Release |release| :ref:`extends the buildInfo command with the psmdbVersion key
<dochome>` to report the version of |PSMDB|. If this key exists then |PSMDB| is
installed on the server. This key not available from |MongoDB|.

Improvements
================================================================================

- :jirabug:`PSMDB-216`: The database command ``buildInfo`` provides the
  ``psmdbVersion`` key to report the version of |PSMDB|. If this key exists then
  |PSMDB| is installed on the server. This key is not available from |MongoDB|.
