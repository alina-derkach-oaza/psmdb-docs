.. _audit-log:

========
Auditing
========

Auditing allows administrators to track
and log user activity on a MongoDB server.
With auditing enabled, the server will generate an audit log file.
This file contains information about different user events
including authentication, authorization failures, and so on.

The following server parameters control auditing.
They are entered at the command line
when starting a ``mongod``  server instance.

``--auditDestination``

  By default, audit logging is disabled.
  Auditing and audit log generation are activated
  when this parameter is present on the command line at server startup.

  The argument to this parameter designates where the log output is directed:
  ``file``, ``syslog``, or ``console``.
  By default, it is saved to a log file.

  .. code-block:: bash

     mongod --auditDestination=file

  .. note:: Auditing remains active until shutdown,
     it cannot be disabled dynamically at runtime.

``--auditPath``

  This is the fully qualified path to the file you want the server to create,
  if you set ``--auditDestination`` to ``file``.
  If this parameter is not specified,
  then :file:`auditLog.json` file will be created
  in the server's configured log path.

  .. code-block:: bash

     mongod --auditDestination=file --auditPath /var/log/psmdb/audit.json

  If log path is not configured on the server,
  then :file:`auditLog.json` will be created in the current directory
  (from which ``mongod`` was started).

  .. note:: This file will rotate in the same manner as the system log path,
     either on server reboot or using the ``logRotate`` command.
     The time of rotation will be added to the old fileâ€™s name.

``--auditFormat``

  This is the format of each audit event stored in the audit log.
  The argument to this parameter can be either ``JSON`` or ``BSON``.
  The default value for this parameter is ``JSON``.

  .. note:: If you set it to ``BSON``,
     then ``--auditDestination`` must be set to ``file``,
     and also ``--auditPath`` must be specified.
     For example:

     .. code-block:: bash

        mongod --auditDestination=file --auditFormat=BSON --auditPath /var/log/psmdb/audit.bson

``--auditFilter``

  This parameter specifies a filter to apply to incoming audit events,
  enabling the administrator to only capture a subset
  of all possible audit events.

  This filter should be a JSON string
  that can be interpreted as a query object.
  Each audit log event that matches this query will be logged.
  Events which do not match this query will be ignored.
  If this parameter is not specified,
  then all audit events are stored in the audit log.

  For example, to log only events from a user named *tim*,
  start the server with the following parameters:

  .. code-block:: bash

     mongod \
    --auditDestination file \
    --auditFormat JSON \
    --auditPath /var/log/psmdb/audit.json \
    --auditFilter '{ "users.user" : "tim" }'

.. _auditAuthorizationSuccess:

Enabling Auditing of Authorization Success
==========================================

By default, only authorization failures for the ``authCheck`` action
are logged by the audit system.
To enable logging of authorization successes,
set the ``auditAuthorizationSuccess`` parameter to ``true``.

.. note:: Enabling this parameter is required
   if you want to filter CRUD operations in the audit log,
   because CRUD operations are logged under ``authCheck`` action.

You can enable it on a running server using the following command::

 db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, auditAuthorizationSuccess: true } )

To enable it on the command line, use the following option
when running ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process::

 --setParameter auditAuthorizationSuccess=true

You can also add it to the configuration file as follows::

 setParameter:
   auditAuthorizationSuccess: true

.. warning:: Enabling ``auditAuthorizationSuccess`` can impact performance
   compared to logging only authorization failures.
